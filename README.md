# Crystal Collector

* You're mining crystals and your cart can only hold up to it's capacity. To win at this game, you must try to fill your cart to it's max capacity without spilling your mined crystals.  

# HOW TO PLAY 
* Start by clicking on any of the 4 crystals. 
* Each crystal is assigned a random number. When a crystal is clicked on, the random number assigned to the crystal is added to your cart under "Crystals Mined".
* **HINT** It is up to you to keep track of the random number assigned to each crystal.
* To win, your "Crystals Mined" must be equal to the "Mine Carts Capacity".
* If you go over the "Mine Carts Capacity", you will get a loss added to your score. 
* If you would like to restart the game and generate new random numbers to each crystal, just hit the "RESET GAME" button.
